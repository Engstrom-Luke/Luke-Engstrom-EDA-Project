1.   I got rid of New Zealand in the Reef Ray
    portion of the results (I did this on both the original version by accident and
    my own version)

```{=html}

```
2.   I cleaned up the pictures, so they do not
    overlap

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.   Added density plots for the Global Reef
    Ray sightings, Global Oceanic Ray sightings, and breeding seasons for Reef Rays

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.   I added the titles of the graph in the
    code

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
5.   I added captions for the density graphs
