## Abstract

-   Manta ray migrate where the food is, which makes them hard to study​

-   In addition, they are at risk from fisheries and bycatch (Stewart et
    al 2016)​

-   Using iNaturalist data to see if there are migration patterns​

-   Then identifying breeding grounds of two different species of manta
    ray​

-   With this information we propose to make these sites protected
    grounds

## Introduction

-   Manta ray are an elusive species, juveniles have never been studied
    in the wild (Stewart et al 2018)​

-   Mobula birostris (oceanic ray) and Mobula alfredi (reef ray) are
    both migratory species​

-   Reef Rays typically have their mating season from October to January
    (Simpkins 2013)​

-   Oceanic Rays are considered year-round, but it depends on what
    waters they are in (Manta Ray Reproduction 2018)​

-   We are working to identify breeding grounds to propose marine
    protected areas

## Methods

-   Using iNaturalist data, a citizen science program used to catalog
    sightings of organisms​

-   Then cleaned up the data using rNat and tidyverse​

-   We filtered the data to include species name, latitude, longitude,
    year, month, and day​

-   Then made a map with the filtered data​

## Results

-   Oceanic rays may have breeding grounds near the west coast of the
    US, Gulf of Mexico, New Zealand, Australia, and Indonesia​

-   Reef rays may have breeding grounds near India in the Maldives and
    Indonesia​

-   Reef rays have higher sightings in winter near India in the Maldives
    and Indonesia​

## Discussion

-   Protected marine grounds could be set up in New Zealand, Australia,
    Indonesia, India, the west coast of the US, and the Gulf of Mexico​

-   The Gulf of Mexico has become a hot spot for the Oceanic rays
    (Stewart et al 2018)​

-   Our data support this because of the high density in the Gulf of
    Mexico​
